The response from GeoIP is based on your IP address, so if you are using a VPN it will give you the geo information of wherever your VPN is connected to and not your actual physical location.

To use open-wc, we have to install a few different dependencies that make it function. Before we install, let's talk about a few of them. First is npm, which is a JavaScript Node package manager. It offers the largest selection of code packages in their software registry. This is typically concurrently used with Node.js. Node.js is a open-source JavaScript runtime environment where code can be executed outside of the web.Both of these JavaScript add-ins make developers lives much easier. They are free to use and open-source that make it possible to share software with others and do things that were not possible before their development. They are very commonly used in web development with back-end tools to allow for runtime processes that can occur quicker and more efficient in the web. Now, let's look at installing these JavaScript helpers.Node",
